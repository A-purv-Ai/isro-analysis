        "The primary objective of this project is to analyze the historical performance of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) launch vehicles and build a predictive model that estimates the probability of mission success. By leveraging machine learning, specifically a Random Forest classifier, I aim to generate a 'Risk Score' for future launches. This score will serve as a quantitative tool for commercial satellite operators and insurance providers to calculate risk-adjusted costs when choosing ISRO as their launch partner."

        "Despite ISRO's reputation as a cost-effective and reliable space agency, recent anomalies in the PSLV program—specifically the PSLV-C61 (May 2025) and the PSLV-C62 (January 2026) failures—have highlighted the need for more granular risk assessment. Traditional reliability is calculated as a simple percentage of historical successes. However, this does not account for the complexity of multi-payload rideshares, rocket configurations, or specific orbital requirements. My project addresses this by moving from static success rates to a dynamic, feature-driven risk prediction model."

        "## Real-World Relevance and Motivation\n",
        "The global small-satellite launch market is becoming increasingly competitive with the rise of private players like SpaceX. For India to maintain its 2033 goal of capturing 8–10% of the global market, it must provide transparency to international customers. High-profile failures like the PSLV-C62 anomaly on January 12, 2026, lead to a 'trust deficit' and immediate spikes in insurance premiums (estimated at 20-30%). This project provides an open-source, data-driven method to quantify these risks, helping startups and commercial partners make informed financial and technical decisions."
